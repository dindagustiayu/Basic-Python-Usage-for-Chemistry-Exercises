## P2.1
The rate of the reaction between $H_{2}$ and $F_{2}$ to form HF increases by a factor of 10 when the temperature is increased from $25 ^oC$ to $47 ^oC$. What is the reaction activation energy? Assume the Arhenius equation applies.

## P2.2 
Calculate the energy (in eV) of a photon with a wavelength of 450 nm. One eV is equivalent to $1.6 $ x $ 10^{-19}$ Joules.

## P2.3 
From back-scattering experimental data, the radius of an aluminum nucleus can be calculated to be approximately 5 x 10 meters. The radius of an aluminum atom is known to be 1.43 x 10 meters. Using atomic weight data from your periodic table, calculate the density of an aluminum nucleus. Express your answer in units of g/m.

## P2.4 
Body fat (triglyceride) has the average chemical formula $C_{55}H_{104}O_{6}$. In the absence of other mechanism (such as ketosis), its metaboilsm is essentially a low temperature combustion to form carbon dioxide and water.

Calculate the mass of $CO_{2}$ and $H_{2}O$ produced when 1 kg of fat is "burned off". Take the molar masses to be M(C) = 12 g $mol^{-1}$ and M (H) = 1 g $mol^{-1}$ and M(O) = 16 g $mol^{-1}$.
What percentage of the original mass of fat is exhaled as $CO_{2}$?.
The balanced chemical reaction for the metabolism of the fat $C_{55}H_{104}O_{6}$ is:
$C_{55}H_{104}O_{6}$ + $78O_{2}$ $\rightarrow$ $55CO_{2}$ + $52H_{2}O$

## P2.5 
What is the boiling point of water on the summit of Mt Everest (8,849 m)?. Assume that the ambient air pressure, p, decrease with altitude, z, according to p = p0 exp(-z/H), Where p0 = 1 atm and take scale height, H to be 8 km. The molar entalpy of vaporization of water is 

$\Delta_{vap}H{m}$ = 44 kJ $mol^{-1}$

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is:

$\frac{dlnp}{dT}$ = $\frac{\Delta_{vap}H{m}}{RT^{2}}$

## P2.6
Calculate the ionization energy (in eV) of an electron in the excited state of n = 3 in a hydrogen atom.

## P2.7
The pfund series of lines in the emission spectrum of hydrogen correspond to transition from higher excited states to the n = 5 orbit. Calculate the wavelength of the second line in the Pfund series to three significant figures. In which region of the spectrum does it lie?
